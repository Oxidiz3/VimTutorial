KEY==========================================================
	() = user input
	<C-()> = ctrl + user input
	<VimMovement.txt> = file name
		press (g)et (f)ile when hovering over file name

	-most commands can be chained or multiplied by numbers
		10j - move down 10 times
		(d)(t)(a) - delete to "a"

	capital letters are important
=============================================================

Any command that changes your block cursor into a line will put you in insert mode
press ESC to exit. I have my CAPSLOCK key mapped to ESC, I strongly recommend you 
do the same

==Basic==
	(i)nsert = insert text before the cursor
	(a)ppend = append text after cursor
	(r)eplace = replace character and exit insert mode

	(I)NSERT = insert text before line
	(A)PPEND = APPEND text after the line
	(R)EPLACE = REPLACE and keep replacing

	(u)ndo = undo last change
	<C-r>edo = redo last undo
	(.) = repeat last action between insert mode and escape

	(o) = new line below cursor
	(O) = new line above cursor

	(y)anking is copying
		(y)(y)ank = yank entire line
		(y)(MOVEMENT MODIFIER) = yank to whatever the modifier says
	
	(x) = delete underneath cursor

	(d)elete
		(d)(d)elete = delete line and save to register
		(d)(MOVEMENT MODIFIER) = yank to whatever the modifier says
	

==Advanced==
	/%s/(target)/(change) = find and replace
		vs code does this way better with most names, with cursor on word press F2

	<C-a> - number plus one 
	<C-x> - number minus one
	
	<C-w> - delete previous word // only in insert mode

	===MOVEMENT MODIFIERS===
		these include most of the commands you learned in the
		<VimMovement.txt> section
		
		(d)(w)ord = (d)elete word
		(y)() = (y)ank this line and line below
		(d)(e)nd = (d)elete end
		(y)(t)o (e) = (y)ank characters up (t)o "e"
