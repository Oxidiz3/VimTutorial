		(g)oto (d)efinition - jump to definition.
		(g)et (h)elp - equivalent to hovering your mouse over wherever the cursor is. Handy
						for seeing types and error messages without reaching for the mouse!
		(g)(q) - on a visual selection reflow and wordwrap blocks of text,
				 preserving commenting style. Great for formatting documentation
				 comments.
		(a)(f) - visual mode command which selects increasingly large blocks of text.
				For example, if you had "blah (foo [bar 'ba|z'])" then it would select
				'baz' first. If you pressed af again, it'd then select [bar 'baz'], and
				if you did it a third time it would select "(foo [bar 'baz'])".
